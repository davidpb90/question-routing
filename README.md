# question-routing

Code for the process of developing a question routing algorithm for Q&A websites. In the ProjectNotebook all the code developed is available as it was being developed, not in a user-friendly format whatsoever. It includes code for clustering analysis, studies of the doubling property of the texts, different versions of the algorithm, data visualizations, among other things. The rest of the files are more organized code blocks that perform specific tasks, sometimes importing some of the functions in other scripts. If the database is available (it was to big to submit to GitHub but I can send it upon request) these scripts can be run independently and the corresponding analysis can be used to do statistical and graphical analysis of the data and the potential algorithms. This repository is being developed, so that eventually it will be organized in such a way that a new user can run the analysis by herself without inconvenients. The pdf attached includes the final report of the project.
